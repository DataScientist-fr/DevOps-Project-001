# Todo List Application

This project is a full-stack web application that provides a platform to manage your todo tasks. The application is split into two parts: the Django API server and the React front-end.


## Django API Server

The Django API server is built with the Django REST framework (DRF) and is connected to an SQLite database. It provides the backend functionality for the Todo List application, including CRUD operations for todo tasks.

## React Front-End

The React front-end provides a user-friendly interface for the Todo List application. It allows you to view, create, update, and delete todo tasks. The interface is responsive and easy to use, making it simple to manage your todo tasks.
